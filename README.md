## Executive Summary
To be completed in the last module of the semester.

### Information System Components
In terms of an amazon purchase made online many components of information systems are utilized. FIrst a customer opens their laptop and presses the power button which is the hardware of the computer. Then the customer logs on to the Amazon website Which has the software that has the order entry website collects ordering information from the customer and collects data into a database. People like data processors, order delivery, order fulfillment, use the data to deliver the product to the customers.The process is the order entry to the delivery of the product and all the data storage in between.
### Software
#### GitHub
While working with GitHub we login and the person logging in is the client while where you are logging into the central computer is the server. There is a lot of information being stored within GitHub that is not stored on a local computer which makes accessing the data more mobile since many devices can utilize it this is known as cloud computing.
#### Screen Capture
For screen capture I used the snipping tool and it allowed me to save a photo of my desktop and created a png file the png file was 79.1KB. I used the snipping tool on my windows 10 laptop. 
#### Application, Utility, and Operating Systems
Application of software such as excel, Word, Visio that has a specific function that helps solve a task.
Utility or programs that allow you to fix or modify your computer. An example would be anti-malware software.
Operating systems manage the programs and data storage of the computer and example would be UNIX or Linux.
#### ERP
ERP is defined as  an enterprise resource planning and is software that brings together an entire organization within one program such as financial software or inventory. An example is SAP.
#### Virtualization
Virtualization is the process of using software to simulate a computer or some other device. Virtualization solves a problem by reducing the amount of hardware needed by a company. hypervisors separate the physical resource from virtual environments by allowing multiple users to be on the same computer.
#### Python
Python is easy to learn and easy to use programming language that allows people to focus on coding and not worry about syntax errors. What a program is compiled it is taking the program down to machine machine language and finds syntax errors at compiled time whereas where as python interprets it at runtime making it more portable 
Python1.jpg a python program that prints hello Meredith
Python2.jpg this program adds two variables together and sums them and then prints them along with my name.
#### Graphic Modeling and Rendering
#### File Compression
#### Artificial Intelligence

### Career Exploration
#### Bureau of Labor Statistics
I would like to be a compliance oficer the median salery is 71000 dollars a year it requires a bachelors degree and it is growing field.
#### Handshake
It it was a bit of work to set up but it seems like an interesting website to navigate and see avalible positions.
#### Certifications, Certificates, and Degrees
Cybersecurity Analyst (CySA+) is an IT workforce certification that applies behavioral analytics to networks and devices to prevent, detect and combat cybersecurity threats through continuous security monitoring. 
Cisco Certifications are the list of the Certifications offered by Cisco Systems. Earning the CISSP proves you have what it takes to effectively design, implement and manage a best-in-class cybersecurity program.
computer networking seems kind of interesting to me.
#### Industry Associations and Student Organizations
he mission of the Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC) system is to provide institutions with an information assurance or computer security curriculum a controlled, competitive environment to assess their student's depth of understanding and operational competency in managing the challenges inherent in protecting a corporate network infrastructure and business information systems.A membership here would be benifical so I could network to like-minded people.
### Computer Architecture
#### CPU
The CPU is the central processing unit or the controller of the computer; it receives commands from the RAM and executes them. The CPU then signals the ALU Arithmetic Logic unit Which performs the mathematical additions or the comparison flags. After the calculations are made the ALU sands the information back to the CPU via the bus to process the next instruction. 
When purchasing an object at the self check out line a user run the barcode across the scanner where the data is input into the CPU. THe CPU stores the data into memory and received instructions such as adding sales tax credit card information and other internal processes. Then it outputs data to the screen to let the customer know how much they owe. Then the CPU signals the printer to print a receipt. 
#### Gates and Circuits
The truth tables basically accept two inputs and outputs one answer. For example an and gate requires both inputs to be one to produce a one on the output. An And gate produces more zeros as the output, whereas the OR gate if either one of the inputs is a one the outputs will also be a one. The OR gate is more likely to produce a one. 
#### IEEE
IEEE is an organization for people in STEM fields such as engineers and programers where people can join this organization and IEEE is dedicated to advancing technology and expect a high degree of professionalism IEEE takes its code of ethics seriously and wants people to adhere or report ethical problems to the company. 
#### Storage
Access time is the time between the data that is requested by the system and the time the data was available by the system.
Transfer rate is measured by how long the data takes to move off the disk
The Difference between SSD  (solid-state disks) and a traditional hard drive is that SSD does not have moving parts to it and  it is much faster to access the data, traditional drives are more prone to fail because of the moving parts .
#### Memory
Increasing speed of RAM impacts the computing speed the computer Can transfer more data to the CPU quicker. The more RAM the more data the computer can hold in the short-term memory and not rely on the hard drive to retrieve the data slowly.
Hard disk storage can hold lots of data whereas RAM holds less data but can  retrieve and send data quicker to the CPU.
