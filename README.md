## Executive Summary
To be completed in the last module of the semester.

### Information System Components
In terms of an amazon purchase made online many components of information systems are utilized. FIrst a customer opens their laptop and presses the power button which is the hardware of the computer. Then the customer logs on to the Amazon website Which has the software that has the order entry website collects ordering information from the customer and collects data into a database. People like data processors, order delivery, order fulfillment, use the data to deliver the product to the customers.The process is the order entry to the delivery of the product and all the data storage in between.
### Software
#### GitHub
While working with GitHub we login and the person logging in is the client while where you are logging into the central computer is the server. There is a lot of information being stored within GitHub that is not stored on a local computer which makes accessing the data more mobile since many devices can utilize it this is known as cloud computing.
#### Screen Capture
For screen capture I used the snipping tool and it allowed me to save a photo of my desktop and created a png file the png file was 79.1KB. I used the snipping tool on my windows 10 laptop. 
#### Application, Utility, and Operating Systems
Application of software such as excel, Word, Visio that has a specific function that helps solve a task.
Utility or programs that allow you to fix or modify your computer. An example would be anti-malware software.
Operating systems manage the programs and data storage of the computer and example would be UNIX or Linux.

TO create a directory on windows I used the cmd comand to get to the powershell window, then I did a mkdir and the directory name this created the directory then I did a dir a nd saw that I created it it.
#### ERP
ERP is defined as  an enterprise resource planning and is software that brings together an entire organization within one program such as financial software or inventory. An example is SAP.
#### Virtualization
Virtualization is the process of using software to simulate a computer or some other device. Virtualization solves a problem by reducing the amount of hardware needed by a company. hypervisors separate the physical resource from virtual environments by allowing multiple users to be on the same computer.
#### Python
Python is easy to learn and easy to use programming language that allows people to focus on coding and not worry about syntax errors. What a program is compiled it is taking the program down to machine machine language and finds syntax errors at compiled time whereas where as python interprets it at runtime making it more portable 
Python1.jpg a python program that prints hello Meredith
Python2.jpg this program adds two variables together and sums them and then prints them along with my name.
#### Graphic Modeling and Rendering
raster-is a picture made up of thousands of pixels, when zoomed in on the pixels become apparent. you would use raster if you wanted to display a photograph.
vector-a vector is an image that is created geometricaly. No matter how much you zoom in or out it does not pixelate. it is typically used in profesional design settings.
lossless-it is when you save the file all origianal data is preserved.
lossy-when you save the data and the data is compressed some data is lost but it is a smaller file. Web developers may not need an image to be high quality and are okay with a less quality picture.
jpeg- they are photos notably with no high contrast. they are also screenshots of different things.
png- it is illustrations,line art, photos with high contrast, and aplication screenshots.
gif- imagage with gradiants and photos.
#### File Compression
File compression is a way to organize A bunch of data and one directory that compresses it to save space. This is especially helpful when you want to send a compressed file so that it can download faster.

#### Artificial Intelligence

### Career Exploration
#### Bureau of Labor Statistics
I would like to be a compliance oficer the median salery is 71000 dollars a year it requires a bachelors degree and it is growing field.
#### Handshake
It it was a bit of work to set up but it seems like an interesting website to navigate and see avalible positions.
#### Certifications, Certificates, and Degrees
Cybersecurity Analyst (CySA+) is an IT workforce certification that applies behavioral analytics to networks and devices to prevent, detect and combat cybersecurity threats through continuous security monitoring. 
Cisco Certifications are the list of the Certifications offered by Cisco Systems. Earning the CISSP proves you have what it takes to effectively design, implement and manage a best-in-class cybersecurity program.
computer networking seems kind of interesting to me.
#### Industry Associations and Student Organizations
he mission of the Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC) system is to provide institutions with an information assurance or computer security curriculum a controlled, competitive environment to assess their student's depth of understanding and operational competency in managing the challenges inherent in protecting a corporate network infrastructure and business information systems.A membership here would be benifical so I could network to like-minded people.
### Computer Architecture
#### CPU
The CPU is the central processing unit or the controller of the computer; it receives commands from the RAM and executes them. The CPU then signals the ALU Arithmetic Logic unit Which performs the mathematical additions or the comparison flags. After the calculations are made the ALU sands the information back to the CPU via the bus to process the next instruction. 
When purchasing an object at the self check out line a user run the barcode across the scanner where the data is input into the CPU. THe CPU stores the data into memory and received instructions such as adding sales tax credit card information and other internal processes. Then it outputs data to the screen to let the customer know how much they owe. Then the CPU signals the printer to print a receipt. 
#### Gates and Circuits
The truth tables basically accept two inputs and outputs one answer. For example an and gate requires both inputs to be one to produce a one on the output. An And gate produces more zeros as the output, whereas the OR gate if either one of the inputs is a one the outputs will also be a one. The OR gate is more likely to produce a one. 
#### IEEE
IEEE is an organization for people in STEM fields such as engineers and programers where people can join this organization and IEEE is dedicated to advancing technology and expect a high degree of professionalism IEEE takes its code of ethics seriously and wants people to adhere or report ethical problems to the company. 
#### Storage
Access time is the time between the data that is requested by the system and the time the data was available by the system.
Transfer rate is measured by how long the data takes to move off the disk
The Difference between SSD  (solid-state disks) and a traditional hard drive is that SSD does not have moving parts to it and  it is much faster to access the data, traditional drives are more prone to fail because of the moving parts .
#### Memory
Increasing speed of RAM impacts the computing speed the computer Can transfer more data to the CPU quicker. The more RAM the more data the computer can hold in the short-term memory and not rely on the hard drive to retrieve the data slowly.
Hard disk storage can hold lots of data whereas RAM holds less data but can  retrieve and send data quicker to the CPU.
#### Data Representation
decimal- base ten each positiom hold 0 to 9 charachters. 
bianary- base 2 each position holds either a zero or a one and each position after theat is two to the power of the other number.
hexadecimal- base 16 each position holds from 0 to F characters. each position after is 16 to the power.
3DecimalConversion.png it is a file that converts a decimal 198 to bianary.
4BinaryConversion.png it is a file that converts bianary to a number.
In a RGB color space, hex #ab0fff is composed of 67.1% red, 5.9% green and 100% blue. The color is purple-ish. This color would not be a good color for readability of for people with certain color blindnesses. The best colors to start with are block or white. The more vibrant your color is the bigger the font.
### Networking Design

#### Data Transmission
Packet - Unit of data 
Packet-Switching - Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address 
IP Address - Unique identifying number 
DNS - Directory of IP address common names.  For example 54.239.26.214 might be the IP address of amazon.com
Protocol - Set of rules to allow devices to communicate 

#### Hardware
Hub- connects an internal network together and transmits all data to all computer within its network.
switch-connects an internal network together an only transmits data to another the intended computer, a sitch is better than a hub because it only sends intended data to intended machines
router - connects the outside world to an internal network accepts only data from data with internal to the network ip adresses. routers are better than switches because it can receive external to the network data
#### Topologies and Types of Networks
single point of failure happen when a computer or a cable breaks and computers are no longer be able to speak to eachother this often happens in ring topography and bus topography and is unlikly to happen to a mesh, or star topography
Infrastructure Topology uses a switch to connect wired devices a single device can go down and the other devices will still be able to talk with one another and wireless Mesh allows wireless devices to communicates to the next closest wireless conecter.
#### Protocols
the primary purpose of a protocal are to do the following functions 
Communication - allows networks and devices to talk to one another
Network management defines procedures for network managment to effectively operate
Security works to ensre that data being passed is both secured and protected

HTTP also known as hypertext transfer protocol is basically the language for web pages. It models a client server because the user acts as  the client and the webpage acts as the back end server.

SSL and TSL are secure ways to protect http by requiring the server to send a certificate to prove its authenticity. TSL is a higher version of SSL and it requires even more authentication.

### IP address 
IP address Is short for Internet protocol address basically is a number is assigned to each computer or device and when computers talk to each other they look for each other‘s IP address and the IP address receives in sends packets to one another.

IP4 was developed in the 1980s with 4 billion unique IP addresses given to devices but this quickly fills up which is why they developed IP6. IP6 was developed in the late 90s and is significantly larger than the IP4 the ip6  is large enough to allow each person to have 1 trillion IP addresses.

### ICANN
Icann is the company that distributes IP addresses in a stable and secure way, this coordination helps us to have a global Internet. Icann does not control content but it does help with the Internet naming system.
### Cybersecurity and Encryption
#### Security Triad
Confidentiality is protected information and is part of the security triad. This would be important for my chart because you do not want the wrong eyes to see your personal information.

Integrity is what you see is what is meant to be seen. This would be important to mychart because you want to know that what you are seeing is true. If the doctors say that you are dying and you are not dying that would be pretty important. It is so you can trust what mychart says.

Availability is data reliability, it is where data is reliably available. If you were looking for information for mychart you want to be able to get data when you want it.

#### Caesar and Polyalphabetic Ciphers
a Cesar cipher does a one time letter shift it is easy to decipher by letter distribution where a polyalphabetic cipher is any cipher based on substitution using multiple substitution alphabets therefore it becomes almost impossible to see the letter shifting and it becomes hard to crack
#### Public and Private Key Encryption
public key encryption is a set of rules that everybody knows and it is public however when two individuals whole different pieces that are private that they share with one another that one combined makes it impossible to crack because the reverse engineering is extremely difficult so it is hard to intercept.
#### Brute-Force Attacks
to protect against brute force attack The user should use long unique passwords it also said to use secure about deck top connections as much as possible and the final way is to use two factor authentication.
### Internet Programming
#### Components of a URL
Terms: 
Scheme Http
Domain www.amazon.com
top level domain - .edu

#### World Wide Web Consortium
Tim Berners-lee is the inventor of the world wide web. He invented it in 1989. The W3C means the World Wide Web Consortium creates standards to ensure the success and long-term growth of the Web.
Web of devices ensures a standard so that any device can access the internet whether it be a computer, phone, car, printer etc.
### Software Development
#### Algorithms
A variable - spam ham and eggs are variable names often used in python on the Monte Python sketch. Similar to foo and bar in other languages. A variable is a name that holds values.
An assignment statement  - when you assign a value to a variable.ma
A function - A named section of code that performs a specific task
Three data types - numeric, string, and list
