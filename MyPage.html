<p>A blend of coffee cake and cinnamon roll, king cake is usually iced in yellow, green and purple â€“ the colors of Mardi Gras -- and is frequently packed with fruit fillings and decadent cream cheeses. Hidden within these season sweets also lie a special surprise: a plastic king cake baby to continue the fun.</p>
